# Tiny Projects 
## Greeting

Using the manning tiny-c-projects book work my way through it creating the projects in multiple languages 
- c
- rust
- python 
- bash 
- go

each one with its own repo.

will display greeting with default name
```bash 
./c_greeting
```

will display greeting with specified name in quotes needs quotes to keep name in argv[1]
```bash
./c_greeting "Jack Daniels"
```

example
with all display luke and not skywalker
```bash
./c_greeting luke skywalker
```
